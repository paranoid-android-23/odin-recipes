    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Pinoy Chicken Curry recipe is the Filipino version of the popular chicken curry dish. It is delicious and easy to cook. The sauce is rich, creamy, and flavorful. It goes well with warm white rice.</p>
    <p>Filipino Chicken Curry usually uses bone-in chicken with skin on. I have been using this for my chicken curry as long as I can remember.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. chicken cut into serving pieces</li>
